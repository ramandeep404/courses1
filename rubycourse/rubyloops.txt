1. program to demonstrate while statement, print numbers from 0 to 4 using while loop

#!/usr/bin/ruby

$i = 0
$num = 5

while $i < $num  do
  puts("#$i" )
  $i +=1
end

2. program to demonstrate for statement, print numbers from 0 to 5 using for loop

#!/usr/bin/ruby

for i in 0..5
  puts "#{i}"
end

3. program to demonstrate break statement in for loop

#!/usr/bin/ruby

for i in 0..5
   if i > 2 then
      break
   end
   puts "#{i}"
end

4. program to demonstrate next statement

#!/usr/bin/ruby

for i in 0..5
  if i == 2 then
    next
  end
  puts "#{i}"
end

5. program to demonstrate redo statement which will give output as infinite loop and continously print 2

#!/usr/bin/ruby

for i in 0..5
  if i == 2 then
    puts "#{i}"
    redo
  end
end
