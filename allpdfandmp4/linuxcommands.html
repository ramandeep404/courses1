<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Linux command is a program or utility that runs on the  CLI – a console that interacts with the system via texts and processes. It’s  similar to the Command Prompt application in Windows.</p>
<p>Linux commands are executed on Terminal by pressing Enter  at the end of the line. You can run commands to perform various tasks, from  package installation to user management and file manipulation.</p>
<p>Here’s what a Linux command’s general syntax looks like:</p>
<p>CommandName [option(s)] [parameter(s)]</p>
<p>A command may contain an option or a parameter. In some  cases, it can still run without them. These are the three most common parts of  a command:</p>
<p>CommandName is the rule that you want to perform.</p>
<p>Option or flag modifies a command’s operation. To invoke  it, use hyphens (–) or double hyphens (—).</p>
<p>Parameter or argument specifies any necessary information  for the command.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. sudo command</p>
<p>Short for superuser do, sudo is one of the most popular  basic Linux commands that lets you perform tasks that require administrative or  root permissions.</p>
<p>When using sudo, the system will prompt users to  authenticate themselves with a password. Then, the Linux system will log a  timestamp as a tracker. By default, every root user can run sudo commands for  15 minutes/session.</p>
<p>If you try to run sudo in the command line without  authenticating yourself, the system will log the activity as a security event.</p>
<p>Here’s the general syntax:</p>
<p>sudo </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also add an option, such as:</p>
<p>-k or –reset-timestamp invalidates the timestamp file.</p>
<p>-g or –group=group runs commands as a specified group  name or ID.</p>
<p>-h or –host=host runs commands on the host.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. pwd command</p>
<p>Use the pwd command to find the path of your current  working directory. Simply entering pwd will return the full current path – a  path of all the directories that starts with a forward slash (/). For example,  /home/username.</p>
<p>The pwd command uses the following syntax:</p>
<p>pwd [option]</p>
<p>It has two acceptable options:</p>
<p>-L or –logical prints environment variable content,  including symbolic links.</p>
<p>-P or –physical prints the actual path of the current directory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. cd command</p>
<p>To navigate through the Linux files and directories, use  the cd command. Depending on your current working directory, it requires either  the full path or the directory name.</p>
<p>Running this command without an option will take you to  the home folder. Keep in mind that only users with sudo privileges can execute  it.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re in /home/username/Documents and want to  go to Photos, a subdirectory of Documents. To do so, enter the following  command:</p>
<p>cd Photos.</p>
<p>If you want to switch to a completely new directory, for  example, /home/username/Movies, you have to enter cd followed by the  directory’s absolute path:</p>
<p>cd /home/username/Movies</p>
<p>Here are some shortcuts to help you navigate:</p>
<p>cd ~[username] goes to another user’s home directory.</p>
<p>cd .. moves one directory up.</p>
<p>cd- moves to your previous directory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. ls command</p>
<p>The ls command lists files and directories within a  system. Running it without a flag or parameter will show the current working  directory’s content.</p>
<p>To see other directories’ content, type ls followed by  the desired path. For example, to view files in the Documents folder, enter:</p>
<p>ls /home/username/Documents</p>
<p>Here are some options you can use with the ls command:</p>
<p>ls -R lists all the files in the subdirectories.</p>
<p>ls -a shows hidden files in addition to the visible ones.</p>
<p>ls -lh shows the file sizes in easily readable formats,  such as MB, GB, and TB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. cat command</p>
<p>Concatenate, or cat, is one of the most frequently used  Linux commands. It lists, combines, and writes file content to the standard  output. To run the cat command, type cat followed by the file name and its  extension. For instance:</p>
<p>cat filename.txt.</p>
<p>Here are other ways to use the cat command:</p>
<p>cat &gt; filename.txt creates a new file.</p>
<p>cat filename1.txt filename2.txt &gt; filename3.txt merges  filename1.txt and filename2.txt and stores the output in filename3.txt.</p>
<p>tac filename.txt displays content in reverse order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. cp command</p>
<p>Use the cp command to copy files or directories and their  content. Take a look at the following use cases.</p>
<p>To copy one file from the current directory to another,  enter cp followed by the file name and the destination directory. For example:</p>
<p>cp filename.txt /home/username/Documents</p>
<p>To copy files to a directory, enter the file names  followed by the destination directory:</p>
<p>cp filename1.txt filename2.txt filename3.txt  /home/username/Documents</p>
<p>To copy the content of a file to a new file in the same  directory, enter cp followed by the source file and the destination file:</p>
<p>cp filename1.txt filename2.txt</p>
<p>To copy an entire directory, pass the -R flag before  typing the source directory, followed by the destination directory:</p>
<p>cp -R /home/username/Documents /home/username/Documents_backup</p>
<p>7. mv command</p>
<p>The primary use of the mv command is to move and rename  files and directories. Additionally, it doesn’t produce an output upon  execution.</p>
<p>Simply type mv followed by the filename and the  destination directory. For example, you want to move filename.txt to the  /home/username/Documents directory:</p>
<p>mv filename.txt /home/username/Documents.</p>
<p>You can also use the mv command to rename a file:</p>
<p>mv old_filename.txt new_filename.txt</p>
<p>8. mkdir command</p>
<p>Use the mkdir command to create one or multiple  directories at once and set permissions for each of them. The user executing  this command must have the privilege to make a new folder in the parent  directory, or they may receive a permission denied error.</p>
<p>Here’s the basic syntax:</p>
<p>mkdir [option] directory_name</p>
<p>For example, you want to create a directory called Music:</p>
<p>mkdir Music</p>
<p>To make a new directory called Songs inside Music, use  this command:</p>
<p>mkdir Music/Songs</p>
<p>The mkdir command accepts many options, such as:</p>
<p>-p or –parents create a directory between two existing  folders. For example, mkdir -p Music/2020/Songs will make the new “2020”  directory.</p>
<p>-m sets the file permissions. For instance, to create a  directory with full read, write, and execute permissions for all users, enter  mkdir -m777 directory_name.</p>
<p>-v prints a message for each created directory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. rmdir command</p>
<p>To permanently delete an empty directory, use the rmdir  command. Remember that the user running this command should have sudo  privileges in the parent directory.</p>
<p>For example, you want to remove an empty subdirectory  named personal1 and its main folder mydir:</p>
<p>rmdir -p mydir/personal1</p>
<p>10. rm command</p>
<p>The rm command is used to delete files within a  directory. Make sure that the user performing this command has write  permissions.</p>
<p>Remember the directory’s location as this will remove the  file(s) and you can’t undo it.</p>
<p>Here’s the general syntax:</p>
<p>rm filename</p>
<p>To remove multiple files, enter the following command:</p>
<p>rm filename1 filename2 filename3</p>
<p>Here are some acceptable options you can add:</p>
<p>-i prompts system confirmation before deleting a file.</p>
<p>-f allows the system to remove without a confirmation.</p>
<p>-r deletes files and directories recursively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11. touch command</p>
<p>The touch command allows you to create an empty file or  generate and modify a timestamp in the Linux command line.</p>
<p>For example, enter the following command to create an  HTML file named Web in the Documents directory:</p>
<p>touch /home/username/Documents/Web.html</p>
<p>12. locate command</p>
<p>The locate command can find a file in the database  system.</p>
<p>Moreover, adding the -i argument will turn off case  sensitivity, so you can search for a file even if you don’t remember its exact  name.</p>
<p>To look for content that contains two or more words, use  an asterisk (*). For example:</p>
<p>locate -i school*not</p>
<p>The command will search for files that contain the words  school and note, whether they use uppercase or lowercase letters.</p>
<p>13. find command</p>
<p>Use the find command to search for files within a  specific directory and perform subsequent operations. Here’s the general  syntax:</p>
<p>find [option] [path] [expression]</p>
<p>For example, you want to look for a file called notes.txt  within the home directory and its subfolders:</p>
<p>find /home -name notes.txt</p>
<p>Here are other variations when using find:</p>
<p>find -name filename.txt to find files in the current  directory.</p>
<p>find ./ -type d -name directoryname to look for  directories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>14. grep command</p>
<p>Another basic Linux command on the list is grep or global  regular expression print. It lets you find a word by searching through all the  texts in a specific file.</p>
<p>Once the grep command finds a match, it prints all lines  that contain the specific pattern. This command helps filter through large log  files.</p>
<p>For example, you want to search for the word blue in the  notepad.txt file:</p>
<p>grep blue notepad.txt</p>
<p>The command’s output will display lines that contain  blue.</p>
<p>15. df command</p>
<p>Use the df command to report the system’s disk space  usage, shown in percentage and kilobyte (KB). Here’s the general syntax:</p>
<p>df [options] [file]</p>
<p>For example, enter the following command if you want to  see the current directory’s system disk space usage in a human-readable format:</p>
<p>df -h</p>
<p>These are some acceptable options to use:</p>
<p>df -m displays information on the file system usage in  MBs.</p>
<p>df -k displays file system usage in KBs.</p>
<p>df -T shows the file system type in a new column.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>16. du command</p>
<p>If you want to check how much space a file or a directory  takes up, use the du command. You can run this command to identify which part  of the system uses the storage excessively.</p>
<p>Remember, you must specify the directory path when using  the du command. For example, to check /home/user/Documents enter:</p>
<p>du /home/user/Documents</p>
<p>Adding a flag to the du command will modify the  operation, such as:</p>
<p>-s offers the total size of a specified folder.</p>
<p>-m provides folder and file information in MB</p>
<p>k displays information in KB.</p>
<p>-h informs the last modification date of the displayed  folders and files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>17. head command</p>
<p>The head command allows you to view the first ten lines  of a text. Adding an option lets you change the number of lines shown. The head  command is also used to output piped data to the CLI.</p>
<p>Here’s the general syntax:</p>
<p>head [option] [file]</p>
<p>For instance, you want to view the first ten lines of  note.txt, located in the current directory:</p>
<p>head note.txt</p>
<p>Below are some options you can add:</p>
<p>-n or –lines prints the first customized number of lines.  For example, enter head -n 5 filename.txt to show the first five lines of  filename.txt.</p>
<p>-c or –bytes prints the first customized number of bytes  of each file.</p>
<p>-q or –quiet will not print headers specifying the file  name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>18. tail command</p>
<p>The tail command displays the last ten lines of a file.  It allows users to check whether a file has new data or to read error messages.</p>
<p>Here’s the general format:</p>
<p>tail [option] [file]</p>
<p>For example, you want to show the last ten lines of the  colors.txt file:</p>
<p>tail -n colors.txt</p>
<p>19. diff command</p>
<p>Short for difference, the diff command compares two  contents of a file line by line. After analyzing them, it will display the  parts that do not match.</p>
<p>Programmers often use the diff command to alter a program  instead of rewriting the entire source code.</p>
<p>Here’s the general format:</p>
<p>diff [option] file1 file2</p>
<p>For example, you want to compare two text files –  note.txt and note_update.txt:</p>
<p>diff note.txt note_update.txt</p>
<p>Here are some acceptable options to add:</p>
<p>-c displays the difference between two files in a context  form.</p>
<p>-u displays the output without redundant information.</p>
<p>-i makes the diff command case insensitive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>20. tar command</p>
<p>The tar command archives multiple files into a TAR file –  a common Linux format similar to ZIP, with optional compression.</p>
<p>Here’s the basic syntax:</p>
<p>tar [options] [archive_file] [file or directory to be  archived]</p>
<p>For instance, you want to create a new TAR archive named  newarchive.tar in the /home/user/Documents directory:</p>
<p>tar -cvf newarchive.tar /home/user/Documents</p>
<p>The tar command accepts many options, such as:</p>
<p>-x extracts a file.</p>
<p>-t lists the content of a file.</p>
<p>-u archives and adds to an existing archive file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check out the more practical examples to know more about  the other functions.</p>
<p>21. chmod command</p>
<p>chmod is a common command that modifies a file or  directory’s read, write, and execute permissions. In Linux, each file is  associated with three user classes – owner, group member, and others.</p>
<p>Here’s the basic syntax:</p>
<p>chmod [option] [permission] [file_name]</p>
<p>For example, the owner is currently the only one with  full permissions to change note.txt. To allow group members and others to read,  write, and execute the file, change it to the -rwxrwxrwx permission type, whose  numeric value is 777:</p>
<p>chmod 777 note.txt</p>
<p>This command supports many options, including:</p>
<p>-c or –changes displays information when a change is  made.</p>
<p>-f or –silent suppresses the error messages.</p>
<p>-v or –verbose displays a diagnostic for each processed  file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>22. chown command</p>
<p>The chown command lets you change the ownership of a  file, directory, or symbolic link to a specified username.</p>
<p>Here’s the basic format:</p>
<p>chown [option] owner[:group] file(s)</p>
<p>For example, you want to make linuxuser2 the owner of  filename.txt:</p>
<p>chown linuxuser2 filename.txt</p>
<p>23. jobs command</p>
<p>A job is a process that the shell starts. The jobs  command will display all the running processes along with their statuses.  Remember that this command is only available in csh, bash, tcsh, and ksh  shells.</p>
<p>This is the basic syntax:</p>
<p>jobs [options] jobID</p>
<p>To check the status of jobs in the current shell, simply  enter jobs to the CLI.</p>
<p>Here are some options you can use:</p>
<p>-l lists process IDs along with their information.</p>
<p>-n lists jobs whose statuses have changed since the last  notification.</p>
<p>-p lists process IDs only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>24. kill command</p>
<p>Use the kill command to terminate an unresponsive program  manually. It will signal misbehaving applications and instruct them to close  their processes.</p>
<p>To kill a program, you must know its process  identification number (PID). If you don’t know the PID, run the following  command:</p>
<p>ps ux</p>
<p>After knowing what signal to use and the program’s PID,  enter the following syntax:</p>
<p>kill [signal_option] pid</p>
<p>There are 64 signals that you can use, but these two are  among the most commonly used:</p>
<p>SIGTERM requests a program to stop running and gives it  some time to save all of its progress. The system will use this by default if  you don’t specify the signal when entering the kill command.</p>
<p>SIGKILL forces programs to stop, and you will lose  unsaved progress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, the program’s PID is 63773, and you want to  force it to stop:</p>
<p>kill SIGKILL 63773</p>
<p>25. ping command</p>
<p>The ping command is one of the most used basic Linux  commands for checking whether a network or a server is reachable. In addition,  it is used to troubleshoot various connectivity issues.</p>
<p>Here’s the general format:</p>
<p>ping [option] [hostname_or_IP_address]</p>
<p>For example, you want to know whether you can connect to  Google and measure its response time:</p>
<p>ping google.com</p>
<p>26. wget command</p>
<p>The Linux command line lets you download files from the  internet using the wget command. It works in the background without hindering  other running processes.</p>
<p>The wget command retrieves files using HTTP, HTTPS, and  FTP protocols. It can perform recursive downloads, which transfer website parts  by following directory structures and links, creating local versions of the web  pages.</p>
<p>To use it, enter the following command:</p>
<p>wget [option] [url]</p>
<p>For example, enter the following command to download the  latest version of WordPress:</p>
<p>wget https://wordpress.org/latest.zip</p>
<p>27. uname command</p>
<p>The uname or unix name command will print detailed  information about your Linux system and hardware. This includes the machine  name, operating system, and kernel. To run this command, simply enter uname  into your CLI.</p>
<p>Here’s the basic syntax:</p>
<p>uname [option]</p>
<p>These are the acceptable options to use:</p>
<p>-a prints all the system information.</p>
<p>-s prints the kernel name.</p>
<p>-n prints the system’s node hostname.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>28. top command</p>
<p>The top command in Linux Terminal will display all the  running processes and a dynamic real-time view of the current system. It sums  up the resource utilization, from CPU to memory usage.</p>
<p>The top command can also help you identify and terminate  a process that may use too many system resources.</p>
<p>To run the command, simply enter top into the CLI.</p>
<p>29. history command</p>
<p>With history, the system will list up to 500 previously  executed commands, allowing you to reuse them without re-entering. Keep in mind  that only users with sudo privileges can execute this command. How this utility  runs also depends on which Linux shell you use.</p>
<p>To run it, enter the command below:</p>
<p>history [option]</p>
<p>This command supports many options, such as:</p>
<p>-c clears the complete history list.</p>
<p>-d offset deletes the history entry at the OFFSET  position.</p>
<p>-a appends history lines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>30. man command</p>
<p>The man command provides a user manual of any commands or  utilities you can run in Terminal, including the name, description, and  options.</p>
<p>It consists of nine sections:</p>
<p>Executable programs or shell commands</p>
<p>System calls</p>
<p>Library calls</p>
<p>Games</p>
<p>Special files</p>
<p>File formats and conventions</p>
<p>System administration commands</p>
<p>Kernel routines</p>
<p>Miscellaneous</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To display the complete manual, enter:</p>
<p>man [command_name]</p>
<p>For example, you want to access the manual for the ls  command:</p>
<p>man ls</p>
<p>Enter this command if you want to specify the displayed  section:</p>
<p>man [option] [section_number] [command_name]</p>
<p>For instance, you want to see section 2 of the ls command  manual:</p>
<p>man 2 ls</p>
<p>31. echo command</p>
<p>The echo command is a built-in utility that displays a  line of text or string using the standard output. Here’s the basic syntax:</p>
<p>echo [option] [string]</p>
<p>For example, you can display the text Hostinger Tutorials  by entering:</p>
<p>echo “Hostinger Tutorials”</p>
<p>This command supports many options, such as:</p>
<p>-n displays the output without the trailing newline.</p>
<p>-e enables the interpretation of the following backslash  escapes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>\a plays sound alert.</p>
<p>\b removes spaces in between a text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>\c produces no further output.</p>
<p>-E displays the default option and disables the  interpretation of backslash escapes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>32. zip, unzip commands</p>
<p>Use the zip command to compress your files into a ZIP  file, a universal format commonly used on Linux. It can automatically choose  the best compression ratio.</p>
<p>The zip command is also useful for archiving files and  directories and reducing disk usage.</p>
<p>To use it, enter the following syntax:</p>
<p>zip [options] zipfile file1 file2….</p>
<p>For example, you have a file named note.txt that you want  to compress into archive.zip in the current directory:</p>
<p>zip archive.zip note.txt</p>
<p>On the other hand, the unzip command extracts the zipped  files from an archive. Here’s the general format:</p>
<p>unzip [option] file_name.zip</p>
<p>So, to unzip a file called archive.zip in the current  directory, enter:</p>
<p>unzip archive.zip</p>
<p>33. hostname command</p>
<p>Run the hostname command to know the system’s hostname.  You can execute it with or without an option. Here’s the general syntax:</p>
<p>hostname [option]</p>
<p>There are many optional flags to use, including:</p>
<p>-a or –alias displays the hostname’s alias.</p>
<p>-A or –all-fqdns displays the machine’s Fully Qualified  Domain Name (FQDN).</p>
<p>-i or –ip-address displays the machine’s IP address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, enter the following command to know your  computer’s IP address:</p>
<p>hostname -i</p>
<p>34. useradd, userdel commands</p>
<p>Linux is a multi-user system, meaning more than one  person can use it simultaneously. useradd is used to create a new account,  while the passwd command allows you to add a password. Only those with root  privileges or sudo can run the useradd command.</p>
<p>When you use the useradd command, it performs some major  changes:</p>
<p>Edits the /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/group, and  /etc/gshadow files for the newly created accounts.</p>
<p>Creates and populates a home directory for the user.</p>
<p>Sets file permissions and ownerships to the home  directory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s the basic syntax:</p>
<p>useradd [option] username</p>
<p>To set the password:</p>
<p>passwd the_password_combination</p>
<p>For example, to add a new person named John, enter the  following command simultaneously:</p>
<p>useradd John</p>
<p>passwd 123456789</p>
<p>To delete a user account, use the userdel command:</p>
<p>userdel username</p>
<p>35. apt-get command</p>
<p>apt-get is a command line tool for handling Advanced  Package Tool (APT) libraries in Linux. It lets you retrieve information and  bundles from authenticated sources to manage, update, remove, and install  software and its dependencies.</p>
<p>Running the apt-get command requires you to use sudo or  root privileges.</p>
<p>Here’s the main syntax:</p>
<p>apt-get [options] </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the most common commands you can add to  apt-get:</p>
<p>update synchronizes the package files from their sources.</p>
<p>upgrade installs the latest version of all installed  packages.</p>
<p>check updates the package cache and checks broken  dependencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>36. nano, vi, jed commands</p>
<p>Linux allows users to edit and manage files via a text  editor, such as nano, vi, or jed. nano and vi come with the operating system,  while jed has to be installed.</p>
<p>The nano command denotes keywords and can work with most  languages. To use it, enter the following command:</p>
<p>nano [filename]</p>
<p>vi uses two operating modes to work – insert and command.  insert is used to edit and create a text file. On the other hand, the command  performs operations, such as saving, opening, copying, and pasting a file.</p>
<p>To use vi on a file, enter:</p>
<p>vi [filename]</p>
<p>jed has a drop-down menu interface that allows users to  perform actions without entering keyboard combinations or commands. Like vi, it  has modes to load modules or plugins to write specific texts.</p>
<p>To open the program, simply enter jed to the command  line.</p>
<p>37. alias, unalias commands</p>
<p>alias allows you to create a shortcut with the same  functionality as a command, file name, or text. When executed, it instructs the  shell to replace one string with another.</p>
<p>To use the alias command, enter this syntax:</p>
<p>alias Name=String</p>
<p>For example, you want to make k the alias for the kill  command:</p>
<p>alias k=’kill’</p>
<p>On the other hand, the unalias command deletes an  existing alias.</p>
<p>Here’s what the general syntax looks like:</p>
<p>unalias [alias_name]</p>
<p>38. su command</p>
<p>The switch user or su command allows you to run a program  as a different user. It changes the administrative account in the current  log-in session. This command is especially beneficial for accessing the system  through SSH or using the GUI display manager when the root user is unavailable.</p>
<p>Here’s the general syntax of the command:</p>
<p>su [options] [username [argument]]</p>
<p>When executed without any option or argument, the su  command runs through root privileges. It will prompt you to authenticate and  use the sudo privileges temporarily.</p>
<p>Here are some acceptable options to use:</p>
<p>-p or –preserve-environment keeps the same shell  environment, consisting HOME, SHELL, USER, and LOGNAME.</p>
<p>-s or –shell lets you specify a different shell  environment to run.</p>
<p>-l or –login runs a login script to switch to a different  username. Executing it requires you to enter the user’s password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>39. htop command</p>
<p>The htop command is an interactive program that monitors  system resources and server processes in real time. It is available on most  Linux distributions, and you can install it using the default package manager.</p>
<p>Compared to the top command, htop has many improvements  and additional features, such as mouse operation and visual indicators.</p>
<p>To use it, run the following command:</p>
<p>htop [options]</p>
<p>You can also add options, such as:</p>
<p>-d or –delay shows the delay between updates in tenths of  seconds.</p>
<p>-C or –no-color enables the monochrome mode.</p>
<p>-h or –help displays the help message and exit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>40. ps command</p>
<p>The process status or ps command produces a snapshot of  all running processes in your system. The static results are taken from the  virtual files in the /proc file system.</p>
<p>Executing the ps command without an option or argument  will list the running processes in the shell along with:</p>
<p>The unique process ID (PID)</p>
<p>The type of the terminal (TTY)</p>
<p>The running time (TIME)</p>
<p>The command that launches the process (CMD)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some acceptable options you can use:</p>
<p>-T displays all processes associated with the current  shell session.</p>
<p>-u username lists processes associated with a specific  user.</p>
<p>-A or -e shows all the running processes.</p>
